# Network monitor - browser extension.

Network monitor - shows requests and responses, including the HTTP headers, of the current page, or globally. 

It is possible to use it at any time, also *after* the page has loaded.

This is useful when there are random errors in some cases and we just want to see what happened, see a list of the past requests. 

It also constantly displays current count of requests in any given tab.


## Installing
